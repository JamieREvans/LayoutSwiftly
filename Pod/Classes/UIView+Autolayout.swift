    Lays out views to a superview (self) and / or to each other. If there are less separations than views, the views are only given constraints on each other.

If there are more separations than views, the views will be constrained completely on the superview - either the superview or one of the views should have an undefined size.

    - parameter direction: Determines the direction used in the visual autolayout string. Pass **"H"** for a horizontal layout and **"V"** for a vertical layout.
